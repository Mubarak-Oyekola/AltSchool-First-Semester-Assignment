      <h3>Why ALT School</h3>
      <p>
        Over the past few years, I've tried many edTech company who always claim
        to have a beginner-friendly course which is always not truth after you
        get in, this affected my tech journey because their course was
        overwhelming for me. I got to know about AltSchool recently through a
        friend who has graduated and i've met and read about a lot of people who
        are the product of the school. AltSchool has a proven track record of
        quality Technology education and it is a beginner-friendly one with
        structured curriculum, hence, the reason why i choose AltSchool because
        i want to learn from the best.
